<ProblemStatement>
<p>
Michael and Nick are living near the famous top-secret Area 51 facility.
The facility is enclosed by a fence and is so large that for
the purpose of this problem we consider the fence being a line
that stretches infinitely into both directions.
</p><p>
Only extremely brave boys are not scared to go to the fence
and peek at the facility. Nick is among the brave ones.
He once came to the fence and saw a number of chimneys with distinct shapes.
As a proof of his bravery he tells everybody what chimneys
he saw from his left to his right.
</p><p>
Michael’s father is working at Area51”and has a facility’s map at his home.
Michael found this map and he can now verify Nick's claim of being near
the facility's fence. However, it turns out to be complicated,
and your task is to write a program to perform this verification.
</p><p>
On a map distinctly shaped chimneys are denoted by capital
letters from A to Z.
Each letter denotes a distinct shape, but chimneys with this shape
can appear more than once on a map. The map uses Cartesian coordinate
system oriented so that the fence is $Ox$ axis and all chimneys are
located on a half-plane with a positive $y$ coordinate.
All chimneys are considered to be points (their sizes and actual
geometrical shapes are ignored for the purpose of this problem).
</p><p>
Nick claims that he looked from a point on the fence where
no two chimneys were on the same line of his
sight (a line that originates from his point of view).
It means that at the point he looked from, all the
chimneys he saw had a well-defined order from left to right.
</p><p>
Michael have already made a preliminary verification of Nick's claim.
He made sure that the number of distinctly shaped chimneys matches
their number on the map. Now Michael needs to perform a final
verification to get a list of x coordinates on a fence (if any)
where the corresponding arrangement of chimneys could be seen from.
This information shall be presented as an ordered list of open intervals
$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_n, b_n)$, so that
$a_1 &lt; b_1 \le a_2 &lt; b_2 \le \ldots \le a_n &lt; b_n$.
Asterisk symbol ("*") is used in place of $a_1$ and/or $b_n$ to denote
interval that extends to infinity on the left or on the right
correspondingly.
Note, that $b_i = a_{i+1} = x$ in case where Nick
could not have been at the point $x$ on a fence, because he
would have seen more than one chimney on a single line of his sight,
but being to the left or to the right
of $x$ yields the order of chimneys that he saw.
</p><p>
The picture below shows that if the boy looks
from the point $x = -7$ he sees the chimneys in the following
order: $C, D, D, C$.
It is so for any point from the set
$(-\infty,-11) \cup (-11,-3.5) \cup (14,+\infty)$ the first
example from the problem statement.</p>

<InputFormat>
The first line of the input file contains an integer number $m$
the number of chimneys at the "Area 51" facility.
The second line of the input file contains a string
of $m$ letters from A to Z that describe the chimneys that Nick
saw from his left to his right. A single letter can be used more than
once (if Nick saw the same shape more than once).
Then follow m lines that describe chimneys on the map.
Each line contains three tokens separated by spaces chimney shape letter
(from A to Z), and two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ chimney coordinates.
On these m lines letters appear in arbitrary order,
but each letter from A to Z appears
the same number of times as on the second line of the input file.
No two chimneys have the same coordinates.
</InputFormat>

<OutputFormat>
Write to the first line of the output file a single integer number $n$
the number of intervals that describe $x$ coordinates on a fence
where Nick could have seen the corresponding arrangement of chimneys from.
Write to the second line of the output file $2n$ numbers
$a_1, b_1, \ldots, a_n, b_n$ using "*" instead of a number
$a_1$ and/or $b_n$ to denote infinity.
Numbers must be precise up to $10^{-6}$.
